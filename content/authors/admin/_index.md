I am an MSc student in Data Science at the Technion, working under the supervision of [Yevgeni Berzak](https://people.csail.mit.edu/berzak/) at the Language, Computation and Cognitition [(LaCC) Lab](https://lacclab.github.io/).
My research focuses on computational approaches to studying human language processing, using eye-tracking data to model reading behavior and linguistic patterns.
By developing and applying computational methods, I aim to uncover the fine-grained dynamics of reading across different contexts, contributing to a deeper understanding of how humans and AI systems interact with language.
